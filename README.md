Atlas DW is the enterprise data warehouse at Seattle Public Schools (SPS). The data warehouse contains a wide variety of student information, as well as a growing amount of personnel data and soon, financials!

Although the data itself is confidential and accessible only from within the SPS, we are working to publish our design and usage documentation here for all to see.
